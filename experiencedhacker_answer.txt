Complicated Script:
We'll complicate the script by using a technique called obfuscation. 
It makes the code harder to understand for antivirus programs without changing its functionality.
(see remote_deletion.py)

Antivirus Bypass Techniques:

We'll explore tools or methods designed to dodge antivirus detection. 
Some frameworks can modify or encrypt the scripts, making it trickier for antivirus programs to catch them.

Dynamic Compilation:

Instead of having a fixed script, we'll dynamically compile it at runtime. 
This means the script generates a new form each time it runs, making it less predictable for antivirus programs.
